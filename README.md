## Talks:
Update talk draft https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1V6kgz4rxWQv_1hDuIGVuL24RRUsnkTPn5hZyoxKP2og/edit#slide=id.g59567419ba_0_0

## To-do list:
Targeting subgroup Jet+X update on nov 11th with:
   1. add SFs for FatJets
   1.  make ntuple->rootple conversion (only for reference signals for now = Lambda 13 TeV) for 2016-2017-2018
   1. Invariant mass plots for reference signal samples (L=13 TeV, M=0.5, 2, 5 TeV)
   1. Limit extrapolation on cross section * BR (stat only, per year)
   1. 2D Limits plot (stat only with unitarity constraint)

What is needed from Roberto: 
   1. Macros for QCD/Other bkgs estimation
   1. Macros for signal systematics 
   1. Q: why do we have produced all these samples considering the Lambda independence on limit extraction?
      R: for now we don't really need to analyse all the samples (the request was made just to be sure on the Lambda independence on limit extraction) (=> check efficiency independence on Lambda at some point!)

-Â [ ] check FJ scale factors in the rootplizer https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/CMS/JetWtagging why are we not using them??


- [ ] JER/JEC corrections have to applied to data only? (default option on the present version of the framework)
- [ ] (add systematics on limit bands with Combine (MATTEO))
- [ ] (check limits independence on Lambda (MATTEO))
- [ ] (TTtW bkg estimate MC based (with cross section))
- [ ] (add fakes study) 
- [ ] (SF study for DY bkg) 
- [ ] (can we find other models for reinterpreting the results?)
