## To-do list:
- [ ] test limit extraction as counting experiment (cut on M(llJ)) (MATTEO)
- [ ] add systematics on limit bands with Combine (MATTEO)
- [ ] check limits independence on Lambda (MATTEO)
- [ ] plot M(llJ) histogram for bkg + signal (to validate Valentina number of events) (MATTEO O VALE?)
- [ ] TTtW bkg estimate MC based (with cross section)
- [ ] add fakes study 
- [ ] SF study for DY bkg 
- [ ] can we find other models for reinterpreting the results? (MATTEO, VALE)
